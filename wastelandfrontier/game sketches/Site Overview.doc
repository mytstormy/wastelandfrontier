Site:  Rebirth?
	Content:
	Story… endgame?
	See - Quests

Players  have a ship/ships 
	can:
		Travel
		Mine/Harvest Resources
		Fight Monsters
		PVP
		Train Skills
		Crafting!!!


Story
	A Waste Planet
	Salvage, Junk, Scraps

This is still part of my idea, but the whole planet is not Desert – that’s too much like Dune…
Also, diff land types allow us to use them as speed modifiers for travel.
(see maps page)

Battlefield Earth – for ideas
Earth was invaded… etc, humans almost totally wiped out…
Also allows for discovery of random/surprise Tech’s…
Human and Alien
Goal?
	Attain enough Resources, Technology to be capable of space flight/ Travel again.
		Then begin on your own planet? Or perhaps transition to space based game…?

Maps – Interactions w/
		Movement on
		Cities on
		Monsters on

Grid Based

Possibly have moving colonies, mobile cities, may be player owned?

World grid uses x,y cords
	Locations are comprised of x,y,z… 
		x, y are as normal coordinates, z is a cell descriptor, or “elevation”?
Z is not so much elevation as a Land Type or Terrain Type
Desert, Forest, Plains, Mountains, maybe Ocean?
Terrain type – affects speed

Travel by
Mostly use a^2 + b^2 = c^2
	Vectors?
Set up waypoints as a premium service.
Travel time = dist x speed.

Cities – a few stationary – static (called – forts, cities, holds, castle, villiage, town?)
Player owned?
Mobile cities?
Highest lvl of ship
Purpose of Mobile city – only place a Spaceship can be built

Mobs on: 
AI? – Roaming? w/ cronjobs
<Random> + <Boundaries> etc…

Mob Types –  Mostly Desert like?  Unless there are diff terrain types – forests plains… etc…
Sandworms
Camels
Elephants
Snakes
Rockfish
Lizards
Scorpions
Spiders…
	See logic used with Resources… will be similar
	They drop random items, resources, and maybe money?

Queries and Logic ideas
		Use several diff pages (20?)
		Or use 3-5 main pages filled with (if) based modules?
Possibly have weather effects,
Affecting sensors
Affecting travel speeds…

	Figure out what types of harvesting will be allowed
Only allowed to harvest when ship is in the location?
Or allow for placeable units, or perhaps drones to send to a location?
Harvesting types?
Ore
Chem/Liquid
Gas
Moisture?
Solar?
Wind?

USE TOOLTIPS
Like WOW and WOW armory
Can be used for links? (I think so)
For everything
Maps
Ships
Equips
Modules
Player info
Etc…
Trade –
Supplies, Food, Water, Fuel
Possibly have certain things available at vendors in 1 town, but not another, and figure out how to make it fluctuate?
Supply and Demand linked to the auctions and sales to vendors…
Auction logic and Vendor Price Logic
Auctions:
Use Auctions that are linked to certain cities?
Or Have personal Bazaars? (make them searchable?)


Vendors:
Certain Basic Items are always available?
Others – Rare Items are available only if someone has sold them to a vendor and then only that quantity are available?


Prices:
The more of a basic item that are sold to a vendor, the lower the price will go.
(market saturation forces prices down…)
But there will be a max/min price… or perhaps cause it to lvl out exponentially?
Use 24 hour avg?  or some sort of average?  
Or make the price change instant?




World Monies…
Credits?  Gold/Silver/Plat?

In and Out – must have semi-even flows
Into world economy from quests and HELM selling to vendors
Out of world economy via repair fees/ bazaar fees / 


Repair Logic
Fairly complex? 
Can repair at vendor for fee
Can also learn repair skills
Must have repair module? And
Have certain repair mats…
Quests…
Structure
Logic
Use page / filename logic
Can use (if) to know when a player is on a page relevant to the “Quest”
Also can check inventory to see if user got an item for quest…
Content

Beginner / Learning quests on a small map?
Then graduate to the larger map?


Diff quest types
Go to a certain “place”
Collect certain “items”
Do a certain “thing / event quest”


Tables 
Quest table
Quest id
Quest name
Quest desc
Quest steps
1
2
3 etc – on a particular link?
Quest log
User id
Quest id
Progress – on a step or done?
Started date/time
Completed date/time


Crafting:
	Using resources – gained from Harvesting / Mining…
Diff crafting types?
Engineering – Elec, modules, comps
Engineering – Skill Chips
Ships Crafting
Ship Equips Crafting
Some things can be purchased at vendor that are needed for Crafting.
Junk/Crafting Mats can be sold to and purchased from vendors.
Some items are always in stock, some are limited, restock at server reset, some are in stock when they are sold to vendor.
Prices and logic – see vendor/Market/Auction house page.

Use “Tooltips” for items, ships, etc… (see wow armory for examples.)

Skills:
Allow use of “Bigger n Better” equipment, ships, also modify some stats…

Numeric Modifiers:
Affect
Sensors?
Mining – amts and speed
Salvage
Repair
Charisma – Trading/Vendor prices
Learning Speed
Ship Stats
Defense
Attack
Hull and Armor
Travel Speed
Power/Energy 
Output
consumption
Flat Ability Modifiers
Allow
Use of higher Level of:
Ships
Armor/Weapons
Other upgrades, modules, etc
Skill points? Vs training time…

Also consider Skills / Experience…
Possibley reward players for using all aspects of the game? Points for each page? Score somehow?

Clones?  What do you lose if you die?  This is VERY important…  What are the consequences?

Re-Spec’s?   for a fee?
Possibly have prizes of Re-Spec Tokens?

Levels are based on # of skill pts spent?  Not necessarily earned?
Setup Brackets and pre-reqs


Make sure to incorporate Credit / Skill pt selling
NO RMTs!!!!
Resources:
Have a defined location and finite amount in that location.
Are spawned periodically based on: 	-    
# of still existing Nodes
Other criteria, possibly regionality…
Rarity
Can also be found on some mobs too, random loot drops… etc.
Can only be seen w/ sensors - ?!? do sensors have a lvl of detail or just a Range?


Resource Types:
Isotopes
Fuel – Hydrogen etc
Radioactive - weapons
Metals
Iron
Copper
Etc…
Silica
Water
Foods, or organics?

Ships: “Land Crawlers”
	Have: Diff “Chassis” / classes
		Stats
		Sizes
		Upgrade Slots
		Weapon/Armor Slots
		
Damage:


Upgrades / Equipment
Propulsion / power core
Engine / Motor
Weapons / Armor
Modules
Cargo
Comp
Sensors


	Shield/Armor/Structure
		Can be partially repaired away from shop
		Must be in shop to repair fully

Damage / Battle Logic
Damage is permanent, in the sense that it doesn’t automatically repair after each fight…
Damage can be repaired
Possibly allow training to equip repair modules that repair over time – at timed interval and for small amounts.

HP types
Structure – Very expensive to repair (last thing damaged)
Hull – Takes damage after armor is depleted.
Armor – Takes damage after Shield is depleted.
Shield – First damage – should regen somehow? after each fight?
